# What is tested

Train all models on the same dataset split of each dataset (80:10:10). Standard hyperparamter for models and datasets are used, the training schedule is shown in the config/ The loss function only accounts for the error in the energy prediction.

# Why is this experiment performed

Establish a baseline of the performance of each model.

# What have we learned
